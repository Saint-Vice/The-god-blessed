# Lab 9
> One of the very dangerous attacks that an adversary can perform is a Cross-Site Request  
Forgery (CSRF) attack. A CSRF attack allows the adversary to perform unwanted actions on  
a web application in which a user is currently authenticated. The task for this week’s laboratory  
work is to create a web application which would be protected from such attacks  

## Tasks
• Create a web application where the user can authenticate  
• Implement CSRF protection for your web application  
• Prove the effectiveness of implemented mechanisms (via video)  

We chose to protect our application via a CSRF Token.  

## Technologies
Java 11
Maven  
Working IDE: InteliJ IDEA
Spring Boot
Spring Security

## How to use
1. import Project with pom.xml
